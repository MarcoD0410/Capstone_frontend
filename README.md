## Challenges
My Challenge was when I deployed it to netilfy , it messed up my whole page just showing the nav bar and I have no idea why. Even deleted it twice and uploaded it again but still changed nothing. Then what was weird it started doing it in vs code and it wasn't before I deployed so im not sure why deploying it made the page worse.
